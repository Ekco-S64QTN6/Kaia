## Unreleased

### Security

- Enforce timezone-aware, signed capability-token issue and expiry timestamps; reject future-issued, expired, non-positive and over-one-hour tokens, reject malformed signatures, non-string scope/timestamp fields, and excessively nested JSON.
- Preserve the existing capability-token JSON fields and HMAC format. Enforce durable single-use token consumption with an atomic SQLite fingerprint registry; fail closed when the registry cannot be updated. Raw tokens and signatures are not persisted.
