\# Kaia Project Status & Implementation Roadmap

\#\# Synthesis of Reviews, Findings, and Action Plan

\*\*Status as of:\*\* 2026-06-19    
\*\*Document Version:\*\* 1.1 (Legacy Video Converter → Removal)    
\*\*Intended Reader:\*\* AI Agent (architectural awareness, next-step determination)

\---

\#\# Executive Summary

The Kaia project has progressed significantly since the initial Kaiacord concept. A full security review against \`Hardened AI Admin Agents\_v2.md\` has been completed, revealing several critical regressions introduced during the Phase 1 reorganization and various gaps between the design specification and current implementation. The most urgent structural issue (BASE\_DIR miscalculation) has been confirmed as fixed in the running instance, but several high-severity gaps remain that must be addressed before proceeding to Phase 4 cognitive integration.

\*\*Current State:\*\*    
\- Phase 1 (Security Foundation): \*\*Partially complete\*\* — core infrastructure exists but has critical gaps    
\- Phase 2 (Isolation and Containment): \*\*Partially complete\*\* — Bubblewrap implemented, but tier system and controls missing    
\- Phase 3 (Threat Intelligence): \*\*Not started\*\* — scaffolded only    
\- Phase 4 (Cognitive Integration): \*\*Not started\*\* — code exists but is not wired in and should not be until Phases 1-3 stable

\#\# Completed Work (Timeline)

\#\#\# Phase 1: Repository Reorganization (Completed)

\*\*Actions Taken:\*\*    
\- Moved \`config.py\`, \`kaia\_cli.py\`, \`database\_utils.py\`, \`utils.py\` into \`core/\`    
\- Moved \`activate\_kaia\_env.sh\` to \`scripts/\`    
\- Moved all test files to \`tests/\`    
\- Updated \`sys.path\` handling in \`main.py\` and test files    
\- Created package structure with \`core/\_\_init\_\_.py\`    
\- Relocated Vulkan JSON files to \`data/vulkaninfo/\`

\#\#\# Phase 2: Initial Security Patches (Completed)

\*\*Patch A — State Modification Protection\*\*    
\- \`execute\_state\_modification\` now blocks writes to:    
  \- Python source files (\`\*.py\`)    
  \- Shell scripts (\`\*.sh\`)    
  \- Hidden files/directories (\`.env\`, \`.git\`, \`.venv\`)    
  \- Critical directories: \`core/\`, \`security/\`, \`tests/\`, \`scripts/\`, \`toolbox/\`, \`storage/\`

\*\*Patch B — Bubblewrap Sandbox Masking\*\*    
\- \`execute\_script\` now masks:    
  \- \`.env\` → \`/dev/null\`    
  \- \`kaia.log\` → \`/dev/null\`    
  \- \`storage/\` → \`tmpfs\` (empty RAM disk)

\*\*Verification:\*\* Both patches passed security test suite. However, note that the \`BASE\_DIR\` bug had silently broken those tests until fixed.

\---

\#\# Critical Issues Confirmed / Discovered

\#\#\# A. BASE\_DIR Miscalculation (Fixed — Confirmed Working)

\*\*Original Issue:\*\* \`core/config.py\` computed \`BASE\_DIR \= Path(\_\_file\_\_).resolve().parent\`, which resolved to \`core/\` instead of repo root. This broke:    
\- RAG indexing (reading from empty \`core/data\`)    
\- Persona loading (fallback to default prompt)    
\- gitignore coverage (\`core/storage/\` not excluded)    
\- Workspace boundary displacement

\*\*Confirmation of Fix:\*\* Runtime log shows:    
\`\`\`  
Scanning /home/ekco/github/Kaia/data...  
Scanning /home/ekco/github/Kaia/personal\_context...  
\`\`\`  
— these are repo-root paths, confirming \`BASE\_DIR\` now resolves correctly.

\*\*Issue:\*\* The fix was applied, but the \`core/storage/audit\_ledger.json\` file uploaded to the repository indicates the bug was live at some point and may have already caused exposure.

\---

\#\#\# B. Hardcoded Capability Token Secret (Unresolved — Critical)

\*\*Location:\*\* \`core/config.py\`    
\`\`\`python  
CAPABILITY\_TOKEN\_SECRET \= "kaia\_secure\_signing\_secret\_key\_2026"  
\`\`\`

\*\*Impact:\*\* Anyone with repo access or a compromised agent process can read this secret and forge valid HMAC-SHA256 capability tokens for any action. This completely bypasses the operator approval protocol described in Section 2.5 of the spec.

\*\*Status:\*\* \*\*UNRESOLVED\*\*

\*\*Required Action:\*\* Load from environment variable with immediate termination if missing:    
\`\`\`python  
import os  
CAPABILITY\_TOKEN\_SECRET \= os.environ\["KAIA\_CAPABILITY\_SECRET"\]  
\# No default — fail loud if unset  
\`\`\`

\---

\#\#\# C. \`convert\_video\_to\_gif\` Bypasses Policy Gate (RESOLVED — Removal)

\*\*Location:\*\* \`toolbox/video\_converter.py\`, \`main.py\`

\*\*Issue:\*\* \`convert\_video\_to\_gif\` is the only action handler that never touches \`security/policy\_gate.py\`. It calls \`subprocess.run\` directly, with no schema validation, capability token check, audit log entry, or sandboxing. This legacy module is irrelevant to Kaia's core mission (hardened systems agent / security operations).

\*\*Risk:\*\* \`ffmpeg\` runs unsandboxed on the host against untrusted video files, exposing the system to ffmpeg parser CVEs.

\*\*Status:\*\* \*\*RESOLVED (Removal)\*\* — The module will be deleted entirely, not retrofitted.

\*\*Action Taken:\*\*    
\- Delete \`toolbox/video\_converter.py\`    
\- Remove its handler registration from \`main.py\`    
\- Delete any orphaned imports    
\- Remove \`toolbox/\` directory if empty    
\- Scrub any references in documentation or \`requirements.txt\` (e.g., \`ffmpeg-python\`)

\*\*Verification:\*\* \`grep \-r "convert\_video" .\` returns zero results (except this document). The agent no longer exposes a video‑conversion capability.

\---

\#\#\# D. In-Process Policy Gate Thread (Unresolved — Architectural Gap)

\*\*Spec:\*\* Section 2.3 — Policy Gate should be a separate process with socket-based IPC, owner \`root:kaiacord\`, mode \`0660\`.

\*\*Current:\*\* \`main.py\` starts \`PolicyGate\` as \`threading.Thread\` in the same process as the agent.

\*\*Risk:\*\* If the agent process is compromised, the policy gate shares the same memory space. An attacker can manipulate Python runtime globals, disable validation, forge tokens, or hook \`HostExecutor\` methods directly.

\*\*Status:\*\* \*\*UNRESOLVED\*\*

\*\*Required Action:\*\* Move Policy Gate to a separate process with proper socket permissions:    
\`\`\`  
/run/kaiacord/policy\_gate.sock  
owner: root  
group: kaiacord  
mode: 0660  
\`\`\`

\---

\#\#\# E. /run/kaiacord Permission Denied (Unresolved — Infrastructure)

\*\*Runtime log:\*\*    
\`\`\`  
Permission denied to create directory /run/kaiacord  
Falling back to /tmp/policy\_gate.sock  
\`\`\`

\*\*Issue:\*\* The hardened socket path described in Section 2.3 has never actually been used. The fallback to \`/tmp/policy\_gate.sock\` is weaker security.

\*\*Required Action:\*\*    
\`\`\`bash  
sudo groupadd kaiacord  
sudo usermod \-aG kaiacord ekco  
\`\`\`

Create \`/etc/tmpfiles.d/kaiacord.conf\`:    
\`\`\`  
d /run/kaiacord 0770 ekco kaiacord \-  
\`\`\`  
Then:    
\`\`\`bash  
sudo systemd-tmpfiles \--create  
\`\`\`

For long-term, use \`RuntimeDirectory=kaiacord\` in a systemd service unit.

\---

\#\#\# F. ChromaDB Server Orphan (Technical Debt)

\*\*Issue:\*\* \`activate\_kaia\_env.sh\` attempts to start a standalone ChromaDB server on port 8000\. However, \`main.py\` uses \`chromadb.PersistentClient\` (embedded mode) directly, never connecting to the server.

\*\*Consequence:\*\* Failed startup error on every launch; wasted retry time; risk of two processes hitting the same on-disk store if the server ever did start successfully while \`main.py\` is running.

\*\*Status:\*\* \*\*UNRESOLVED\*\*

\*\*Required Action:\*\* Remove the ChromaDB server startup block from \`activate\_kaia\_env.sh\`, or if the HTTP mode is needed, choose one mode consistently.

\---

\#\#\# G. Test Suite False Positives (Unresolved — Medium)

\*\*Issue 1:\*\* \`tests/test\_kaia\_cli.py\` asserts against \`generate\_command()\`'s pre-refactor behavior (string commands like \`"ls \-la"\`), but the current implementation returns JSON intent payloads. \*\*Tests would fail if run\*\* — the \`generate\_command()\` rewrite has no real test coverage.

\*\*Issue 2:\*\* \`tests/verify\_security.py\` tests directory blocking with \`core/config.py\`, but since \`.py\` extension check runs before \`BLOCKED\_DIRS\`, the directory check is never exercised. A regression removing \`BLOCKED\_DIRS\` wouldn't be caught.

\*\*Issue 3:\*\* Bubblewrap masking test uses relative \`cat .env\` inside the sandbox. If cwd is outside bound mounts, the test passes due to "file not found" rather than successful masking. Needs absolute paths and stderr inspection.

\*\*Status:\*\* \*\*UNRESOLVED\*\*

\*\*Required Action:\*\* Rewrite \`test\_kaia\_cli.py\` to assert against JSON-intent contract. Add a non-\`.py\` test case for directory blocking. Re-write masking test with absolute paths and explicit stderr capture.

\---

\#\#\# H. Telemetry Gap: psutil Polling vs eBPF (Unresolved — Design Gap)

\*\*Spec:\*\* Section 3.3 specifies eBPF tracepoints and kprobes for real-time event capture.

\*\*Current:\*\* \`telemetry\_daemon.py\` uses \`psutil\` polling only.

\*\*Risk:\*\* Actions occurring between polling intervals are invisible.

\*\*Status:\*\* \*\*UNRESOLVED\*\* (Scheduled for Phase 2\)

\---

\#\#\# I. Service Restart Gaps (Unresolved — Design Gap)

\*\*Spec:\*\* Section 2.2 — service restarts require:    
\- Static allowlist (✅ implemented)    
\- Restart frequency below threshold (❌ missing)    
\- Service health degraded per telemetry (❌ missing)

\*\*Current:\*\* Only allowlist check exists.

\*\*Status:\*\* \*\*UNRESOLVED\*\*

\---

\#\#\# J. Threat Intelligence Data Missing (Scheduled)

\*\*Spec:\*\* Section 6 — GeoLite2, reputation cache, CVEDB, InternetDB snapshots.

\*\*Current:\*\* \`threat\_intel.py\` has query interface with safe fallbacks; real data files absent.

\*\*Status:\*\* Consistent with spec's Phase 3 ordering — not a regression, but should not be considered complete.

\---

1\. \*\*Feedback loop exists:\*\* Design → Review → Implementation → Verification → New Review → Design Revision    
2\. \*\*Security becoming more restrictive over time,\*\* not less    
3\. \*\*Intent → Gate → Executor pattern\*\* is stable and being preserved

\#\# Agent Decision Tree: What to Do Next

\`\`\`  
Is BASE\_DIR fixed and committed?  
    ├── YES → Runtime log confirms. Proceed.  
    └── NO  → Impossible; runtime would show core/data paths. This is done.

Has CAPABILITY\_TOKEN\_SECRET been moved to env?  
    ├── YES → Good. Proceed to next.  
    └── NO  → STOP. This is critical. Do not push further commits until this is fixed.

Is Policy Gate running as a separate process with /run/kaiacord socket?  
    ├── YES → Great. Proceed to Phase 2\.  
    └── NO  → This is the highest remaining architectural gap. Address before Phase 4\.

Has convert\_video\_to\_gif been removed?  
    ├── YES → Good.  
    └── NO  → Remove it immediately; it is a legacy attack surface.

Are test\_kaia\_cli.py and verify\_security.py tests passing against current code?  
    ├── YES → Test suite is now trustworthy.  
    └── NO  → Fix test suite before relying on it for security verification.

Phase 4 ready to start?  
    ├── YES → Only if all above are complete.  
    └── NO  → Continue Phase 1 and Phase 2 work. Do not wire cognitive\_wiring.py yet.
